## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One challenge I had was setting up the Recyclerview such that the item, price, and url/location inputted would be displayed properly on the phone. It took a lot of time to read through the resources and the code on Recyclerview to understand what connects what to the Recyclerview. Another challenge I had was that text from the recyclerview would overlap on my text edit input, but I was able to put "android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan"" to prevent the overlap.
Other than that, I did attempt to work on long press delete and clicking on URL, but it was of no avail. I will likely reattempt this in my spare time once I get a better understanding of Recyclerview.
